            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Harvard Wants To Build Artificial Intelligence As Smart As You</h1><p>In many ways, artificial intelligence is already very advanced. There are machines that can take more than 90 percent of the work humans used to do in certain factories. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's goal for 2016 is to build his own personal AI assistant.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd163671cd7ba4cc9348d1c971333850368a98b1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
